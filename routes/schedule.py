#TODO: separate games, from teams, from schedule and fetch data from local
#database.  Done this way because the source data is fetched at each request
#instead of regularly fetching the data and applying it to a local database
#and then having the app API use the local database, implement models, etc.
#This is not required for the initial version and would be a refactoring of the
#existing code when these features are required.  The next iteration of this
#API would only store the raw NHL results in a database and not make NHL API
#requests on every request.  However the userbase is not large enough to
#warrant this dev time.
